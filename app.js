In Next.js 15, using the `app` directory with server components and client components can lead to unexpected behavior if data fetching isn't handled correctly. For example, if a server component fetches data and passes it down to a client component, but the client component tries to re-fetch the same data, it could cause inconsistencies or race conditions.  This is particularly true if the data is time-sensitive or depends on user interactions.  Another less common issue is related to how `getServerSideProps` interacts with the `app` directory's routing.  If not used carefully, it can cause conflicts or unexpected rendering behavior.
