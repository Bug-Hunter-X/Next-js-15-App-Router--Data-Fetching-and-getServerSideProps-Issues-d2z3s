The solution involves centralizing data fetching in the server component and using appropriate caching mechanisms to prevent redundant fetches.  Avoid re-fetching data in client components unless absolutely necessary. For `getServerSideProps`, use it sparingly in the app directory and be mindful of how it interacts with the new routing and data fetching patterns.  Consider using `async/await` for more organized data fetching in your server components.  If using `getServerSideProps`, make sure it's returning the data in the correct format for the app directory's context.
