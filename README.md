This repository demonstrates a common and an uncommon bug in Next.js 15's App Router related to data fetching. The `app.js` file shows the buggy implementation which leads to inconsistencies. `appSolution.js` provides a corrected version. The main problems are inconsistencies in data fetching when using both server and client components together and unexpected behavior due to improper use of `getServerSideProps` within the app directory.  Solutions focus on efficient data flow and careful handling of `getServerSideProps` in the new routing system.
